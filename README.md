## üìù Overview

This week focused on understanding the **syntax**, **data types**, **control structures**, and **core concepts** required to start writing Java programs. By the end of Week 1, you'll be able to:
- Write simple Java programs
- Use variables and data types
- Control program flow
- Work with arrays and strings

## üìå Topics Covered

### Day 1: Introduction to Java
- What is Java?
- History and importance of Java
- Setting up the Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Writing and running the first Java program (`Hello, World!`)
- Basic structure of a Java program (classes, `main` method)

### Day 2: Variables, Data Types, and Operators
- Declaring and initializing variables
- Primitive data types (`int`, `double`, `boolean`, `char`, etc.)
- Intro to non-primitive types (`String`)
- Java operators (arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment)
- Type casting and conversions

### Day 3: Control Flow
- Conditional statements: `if`, `else if`, `else`
- `switch` statement
- Loops: `for`, `while`, `do-while`
- Loop control: `break`, `continue`

### Day 4: Arrays
- What are arrays?
- Declaring, initializing, and accessing arrays
- Iterating through arrays
- Multidimensional arrays

### Day 5: Strings
- The `String` class and creating string objects
- Common string methods (`length()`, `charAt()`, `substring()`, etc.)
- String comparison (`equals()`, `equalsIgnoreCase()`)
- String concatenation
- Immutability of strings
